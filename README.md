# Python Music Compiler

This project provides two scripts for compiling `.wav` and `.mp3` music files into seamless audio tracks: `simple_compiler.py` and `weighted_compiler.py`.

- **`simple_compiler.py`**: A basic script that merges all audio files from a folder into a single track with fade-in and fade-out effects.
- **`weighted_compiler.py`**: An enhanced version that ensures fair distribution of music selection using an Excel-based history to control track frequency. This is an ideal solution for small content creators who want to maintain usage records without needing a database.

## Features
### `simple_compiler.py`
- Combines multiple `.wav` and `.mp3` files into a single audio track.
- Automatically applies 3-second fade-in and fade-out effects for smooth transitions.
- Allows setting a maximum duration for the output file to manage its length.
- Generates a text file listing the track names and their start times for easy reference.

### `weighted_compiler.py`
- All features from `simple_compiler.py`, plus:
- Uses an Excel file to track usage history of tracks.
- Implements inverse probability weighting to ensure less frequently used tracks have a higher chance of being selected.
- Allows creators to maintain a simple track history without requiring a database.
- Ideal for small content creators who want fair and controlled music selection over time.
- Requires an Excel file (`usage_history.xlsx`) with the following columns:
  - `music_path`: The file path of the music track.
  - `folder_path`: The directory containing the music file.
  - `n_usage`: The number of times the track has been used.
  - `deleted_renamed`: A flag indicating whether the file was deleted or renamed.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later must be installed on your system.
- The `pydub` library is required for audio processing.

## Dependencies
The following Python packages are required:
- `pydub`: For audio manipulation.
- `ffmpeg`: Required by `pydub` for audio processing. Ensure it is installed and available in your system PATH.

Install `ffmpeg` using your system's package manager. For example:
- On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```
- On MacOS (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
- On Windows, download it from [FFmpeg's official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/biagolini/PythonMusicCompiler.git
   cd PythonMusicCompiler
   ```

2. **Create the Source Files Directory**  
   Inside the project directory, create a folder named `SourceFiles`:
   ```bash
   mkdir SourceFiles
   ```
   Place all your `.wav` and/or `.mp3` files inside this folder.

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required libraries using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running `simple_compiler.py`
```bash
python3 simple_compiler.py
```

The script will:
1. Process all `.wav` and `.mp3` files in the `SourceFiles` folder.
2. Apply fade-in and fade-out effects.
3. Combine the audio files into a single track.
4. Save the compiled track as `OutputFiles/combined_audio.wav`.
5. Generate a text file (`audio_list.txt`) listing the track names and their start times.

### Running `weighted_compiler.py`
```bash
python3 weighted_compiler.py
```

This script follows a more advanced approach by:
1. Reading an Excel file (`usage_history.xlsx`) to track how often each track is used.
2. Using a probability weighting method to prioritize lesser-used tracks.
3. Compiling the selected tracks into a single audio file.
4. Updating the Excel file with the new usage history after processing.

### Example

1. Place `.wav` and/or `.mp3` files in the `SourceFiles` folder:
   ```
   SourceFiles/
   â”œâ”€â”€ track1.wav
   â”œâ”€â”€ track2.mp3
   â””â”€â”€ track3.wav
   ```

2. Run `simple_compiler.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 simple_compiler.py
   ```
   or run `weighted_compiler.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 weighted_compiler.py
   ```

3. The output will be saved as:
   ```
   OutputFiles/
   â”œâ”€â”€ combined_audio.wav
   â””â”€â”€ audio_list.txt
   ```

   Example content of `audio_list.txt`:
   ```
   0:00 - track1.wav
   3:45 - track2.mp3
   7:15 - track3.wav
   ```
