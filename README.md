# Python Music Compiler

This project is a simple yet powerful tool for compiling `.wav` and `.mp3` music files into a single track, designed to help creators produce seamless background music for YouTube videos. By automatically applying fade-in and fade-out effects, this project creates a polished audio track ready for use.

## Features
- Combine multiple `.wav` and `.mp3` files into a single audio track.
- Automatically applies 3-second fade-in and fade-out effects for smooth transitions.
- Allows setting a maximum duration for the output file to manage its length.
- Generates a text file listing the track names and their start times for easy reference or inclusion in video descriptions.
- Exports the final audio as `combined_audio.wav`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later must be installed on your system.
- The `pydub` library is required for audio processing.

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:
- `pydub`: For audio manipulation.
- `ffmpeg`: Required by `pydub` for audio processing. Ensure it is installed and available in your system PATH.

Install `ffmpeg` using your system's package manager. For example:
- On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```
- On MacOS (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```
- On Windows, download it from [FFmpeg's official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/biagolini/PythonMusicCompiler.git
   cd PythonMusicCompiler
   ```

2. **Create the Source Files Directory**  
   Inside the project directory, create a folder named `SourceFiles`:
   ```bash
   mkdir SourceFiles
   ```
   Place all your `.wav` and/or `.mp3` files inside this folder.

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required libraries using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the project with the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

The script will:
1. Process all `.wav` and `.mp3` files in the `SourceFiles` folder.
2. Apply fade-in and fade-out effects.
3. Combine the audio files into a single track.
4. Save the compiled track as `OutputFiles/combined_audio.wav`.
5. Generate a text file (`audio_list.txt`) listing the names of the tracks and their start times in the format `minutes:seconds - filename`.

### Notes
- The `audio_list.txt` file can be used to easily create video descriptions for YouTube, listing the music tracks and their starting times.
- If you wish to ensure all tracks are included regardless of their combined duration, set the `target_duration_seconds` parameter to `None` in the script.

### Example

1. Place `.wav` and/or `.mp3` files in the `SourceFiles` folder:
   ```
   SourceFiles/
   â”œâ”€â”€ track1.wav
   â”œâ”€â”€ track2.mp3
   â””â”€â”€ track3.wav
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. The output will be saved as:
   ```
   OutputFiles/
   â”œâ”€â”€ combined_audio.wav
   â””â”€â”€ audio_list.txt
   ```

   Example content of `audio_list.txt`:
   ```
   0:00 - track1.wav
   3:45 - track2.mp3
   7:15 - track3.wav
   ```
